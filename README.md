# "Fork me on GitHub" CSS ribbon

## About

This is a recreation of the
["Fork me on GitHub" ribbons](https://github.com/blog/273-github-ribbons) in
CSS, making it resolution-independent.

### Demo

See 'em in action at the
[demo](http://simonwhitaker.github.com/github-fork-ribbon-css)!

### Using

To use these in your own site, download the compiled CSS from the `dist/`
folder, and check the source of the demo page to see how to use it.

## Hacking

Feel free to fork, tweak and send me a pull request.

### Compiling

If you are going to edit the [SCSS](http://sass-lang.org) source, you will
need the [Compass](http://compass-style.org) Ruby Gem:

```
$ gem install compass
```

Once that's installed, you can recompile the stylesheets with a simple
`compass compile`.
