# "Fork me on GitHub" CSS ribbon

This is a recreation of the [Fork me on GitHub ribbon](https://github.com/blog/273-github-ribbons)
in CSS, hence resolution-independent.

See 'em in action! <http://simonwhitaker.github.io/github-fork-ribbon-css/>

Feel free to fork, tweak and send me a pull request.
