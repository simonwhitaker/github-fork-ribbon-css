# "Fork me on GitHub" CSS ribbon

This is a recreation of the [Fork me on GitHub ribbon](https://github.com/blog/273-github-ribbons)
in CSS, hence resolution-independent.

## Usage

### Download

To use it on your site, just view source and copy the two marked sections (one the CSS, the other the HTML tag). You'll also need to grab the [CSS files here](https://github.com/simonwhitaker/github-fork-ribbon-css/).

### Fork Me

Alternatively, [fork the project on GitHub](https://github.com/simonwhitaker/github-fork-ribbon-css/fork)!

### Using with Bower

You can install the CSS files using [Bower](http://bower.io/).

```sh
bower install github-fork-ribbon-css
```

### Using with cdnjs

You can use github-fork-ribbon-css through the CDN provided by [cdnjs](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/github-fork-ribbon-css)
